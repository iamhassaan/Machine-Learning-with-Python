# Machine-Learning-with-Python
This repository contains codes in Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in Python in the zip format


The files with .py format are of Neural Networks.

Please Note that, I am sharing these codes to educate others, as it was quite hard for me to write these, when I was working on them. 

Thank you, and remember me in your prayers.
